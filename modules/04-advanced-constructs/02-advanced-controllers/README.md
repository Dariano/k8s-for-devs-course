# Instructions

## 1

You need to run a computational task that takes data, processes it and loads it
into another store. Here's the container that will make that work:

```
```

Pick one of the advanced resources we have discussed in this module that fits
best for this task.

## 2

You need to write a simple agent that will collect information from the
`/var/logs/..` directory of each one's of the K8s cluster nodes.

Here's the agent's container:

```
```

Pick one of the advanced resources we have discussed that will be best fitted to
this job.

## 3

We need to run 3 containers that should have predictable DNS names. Let's say
**q-1.queue.default**, **q-2.queue.default** and **q-3.queue.default**.

For now, we can just run the busybox container with a simple sleep command in
each one of the containers.

Pick the best resource from what we have learned to deploy this containers in
K8s.
